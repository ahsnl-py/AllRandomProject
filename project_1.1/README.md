#  SPACE INVADER 

### About 
A simple pygame I created from scarth. Alien invasion is two-dimensional fixed shooter game in which the player control the ship while shooting at descending alien space ship. The player will shoot with laser cannon and as the player shooting ability improve, the game will get more intense. So prep yourself. 


Open alien_invasion.py and run the program. The game is simple and easy to play :)
